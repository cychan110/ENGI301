ENGI301 Project 1
SwitchBot

This program takes input from a Bluetooth receiver to control two servos and obtain temperature and humidity readouts from sensors.
To execute the commands, run switchbot.py on cloud9.
To input either "On" or "Off", pair the pocketbeagle with a bluetooth-enabled computer/phone and run the custom app(not yet built).
The program will provide two options, on and off, so the user can simply hit the desired switch status.
All necessary libraries are imported when switchbot.py is run.
